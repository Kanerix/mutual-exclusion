# Mutual Exclusion

Welcome to the Muteal-Exclusion project. This is developed following the course **Distributed Systems** at ITU.

## Usage

This section will tell you how to start the server.

In this version all nodes are hardcoded (ports can not change).

You need to do is run all the nodes at the same time.

```bash
go run server/main.go 3001
go run server/main.go 3002
go run server/main.go 3003
```
